Complete any one of the project to get the certification
Project 1 or Project 2
Steps to complete the Course end Project 1:
To provide the solution with screenshots

1.	Provide the screenshot of your code repository in GIThub
Github – you will using the repository : https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git

2.	You will provide screenshot of Building the code using pipeline as Code in Jenkins
Create a pipeline with maven, in Jenkins. You will create stages:
	Clone the repo
	Compile
	Test
	Package   
3.	You will also provide us screenshots of the console output of package job
And target folder with addressbook.war file
4.	In the same pipeline create a new stage to build the image. The code repository includes your docker file. Use the same dockerfile to build the image , use the similar code:

stage('Build Image'){
            steps{
             sh “cp var/lib/Jenkins/jobane/workspace/target/addressbook.war .”
               sh 'docker build -t myimagejenkins .'
            }
        }
5.	Add one more stage to push image to dockerhub
        stage('Push image to dockerhub'){
            steps{
                sh 'docker tag myimagejenkins edu123/myimagejenkins:$BUILD_NUMBER'
                sh 'docker login --username edu123 --password Edureka@123'
                sh 'docker push edu123/myimagejenkins:$BUILD_NUMBER'
            }
        }
6.	Add a stage to create containers using the above image
Save the job


Go to instance to give jenkins permission to execute docker commands. As of now we are logged in as admin in jenkins and it doesnt have permission to run docker commands.


So go to
vim /etc/sudoers
I
add under root
Jenkins ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
:wq!


Go back to jenkins and build now.
Provide screenshots of application deployed on container.
[Optional]
7.	You may install ansible on the same server as that of Jenkins
 And run the following ansible playbook:

---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: install docker
    yum: name=docker state=present
  - name: start docker
    service: name=docker state=started
  - name: create container
    command: docker run -itd -P myadd:ansible2

Steps for execute project 2:

Execute the same steps till docker as mentioned above
Once image is available, you can push the image to dockerhub
Then you will take the Kubernetes cluster (GKE or Lab)
You will create replicas of the image that was created in docker step
	You will screenshot of pods created
If you want you can also implement HPA to monitor and autoscale your pods
You will share screenshots of :
	HPA YAML
	Autoscaling pod
You will then deploy Prometheus POD and give screenshot with some Prometheus queries
You will also set up Grafana and give us the screenshot of Kubernetes dashboard
